## üîÅ Function Mapping Table

| Fortran Function         | Python Equivalent                   | Status      | Notes                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `do_conductor`           | `do_conductor`                      | In Progress | Will be split into setup, Green's function, transmittance, and output |
| `transfer_mtrx`          | TBD                                 | Pending     | Required to proceed beyond Green‚Äôs function lead construction         |
| `workspace_allocate`     | Handled in `init_conductor_data()`  | Removed     | Replaced by numpy array allocations                                   |
| `memusage`, `flush_unit` | Python `logging` module             | Removed     | Simplified and handled using standard logging                         |
| `transfer_mtrx`          | `compute_surface_transfer_matrices` | Translated  | Fully implemented using NumPy; follows Sancho-Rubio method            |
| `green`                  | `compute_surface_green_function`    | Translated  | Handles `igreen = -1, 0, 1` for surface and bulk Green‚Äôs functions    |

## üìå Additional Notes

- Global variables from Fortran modules are being passed explicitly in Python.
- Obsolete or utility routines that are replaced with NumPy or Python standard libraries are removed.
- Function signatures in Python include type hints and docstrings following Google-style documentation.
